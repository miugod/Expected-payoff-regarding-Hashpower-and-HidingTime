# Background
## Linear structure of a PoW blockchain
In a PoW blockchain system, every block N should only be mined after block N-1 is mined, because N needs to include the time stamp of N-1, which is not revealed until N is published.
## Misbehaviour of Miners
If I have mined N, and want to get higher probability for the next block N+1 mined by also myself, do I want to risk by postponing the publishing time of N?
